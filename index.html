        I don’t even know where to begin — because words feel too small when it comes to you.
        You’ve turned my life into something I never thought it could be — softer, warmer, and filled with a kind of peace that only your presence can bring.

        Every laugh you share, every glance, every word — they all stay with me, like little echoes of happiness that never fade.
        You’ve taught me what it feels like to care without holding back, to love without needing reasons, and to find joy in the tiniest moments.

        You make my world brighter in ways you’ll probably never fully realize.
        And I just wanted to make this day — your day — a reflection of how deeply you’re cherished.

        So here’s to you, my sunshine and calm, my constant thought and favorite person.

        Happy 21st birthday, my Cutuuu.
        May this year bring you the same light and love you’ve brought into my life — a thousand times over.
